Welcome to the Apache CXF Distributed OSGi DSW Reference Implementation
=======================================================================


The dOSGi subproject of Apache CXF provides the Reference Implementation
of the Distribution Software (DSW) component of the Distributed OSGi
Specification[1].


This release is provided for your convenience in three different 
distribution formats:

1. Multi-bundle distro: cxf-dosgi-ri-multibundle-distribution-1.0.{tar.gaz|zip}

Contains the dOSGi implementation and all 3rd party dependencies as 
separate bundles within an archive. The current distribution is an
instance of this type. The easiest way to get started is to explode
this archive into your Felix or Equinox installation tree. Then
append the contents of the felix.config.properties.append or
equinox.config.ini.append snippets found in the conf directory to 
your felix.config.properties or equinox.config.ini. This will cause
all the required bundles to be loaded on start-up.


2. Single-bundle distro: cxf-dosgi-ri-singlebundle-distribution-1.0.jar

Contains the dOSGi implementation and all 3rd party dependencies wrapped
in a single OSGi bundle so as to allow direct installation in your favourite 
OSGi container in one fell swoop.

	
3. Source distro: cxf-dosgi-ri-source-distribution-1.1-SNAPSHOT.{tar.gz|zip}

Contains the entire source tree for dOSGi.


The best starting point for using dOSGi is the Getting Started Guide[2].

Also note the very detailed walk-through of the greeter demo[3].

If you need more help, or want to provide any feedback, please feel free 
to drop us a note on the CXF dev or users list[4].
 
If you trip over any problems with dOSGi, don't hesitate to submit an issue
to the CXF JIRA[5] with the component set to "Distributed-OSGi".


Thanks for using dOSGi!

Regards,
The CXF dOSGi team.
